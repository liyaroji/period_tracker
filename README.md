### Project Description
Our app helps you track your menstrual cycle, predict ovulation periods, and plan or prevent pregnancy with ease. Whether you‚Äôre monitoring your health, trying to conceive, or just staying informed, SYNC is here to support you every step of the way.

With our Menstrual Tracker, you can log and analyze your cycles to better understand your body‚Äôs patterns and anticipate upcoming periods. Our Ovulation Tracker provides precise predictions for your fertile window, making family planning or avoiding pregnancy more manageable. Additionally, our Pregnancy Checker offers insightful tools to help you track early signs of pregnancy or confirm with your healthcare provider.

At SYNC, we believe in making health management simple, reliable, and accessible.

### The Problem statement
Many individuals struggle to track their menstrual cycles effectively, leading to confusion about the timing of periods, ovulation, and fertility. Additionally, there is often a lack of accessible and reliable information on menstrual health, making it difficult to manage physical and emotional well-being throughout the cycle.

### The Solution
 A web application that allows users to input their menstrual cycle data, providing them with key insights such as the expected start date of their next period, ovulation window, and fertile days. The website will also include educational content on menstrual health, lifestyle tips for cycle management, and a simple, intuitive interface that empowers users to better understand and manage their cycles
